# Analysis of Investment Portfolios (Challenge #4 of FinTech Bootcamp)

In this challenge, I evaluated the performance, volatility, and risk profiles of investment portfolios, and compared them against a benchmark. 

## Technologies

This project uses Python 3.7 and imports the following packages:

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - For data structuring and analysis.
[pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - For path-hadling operations.
[numpy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/) - For volatility calculations.

## Lessons Learned

1- Automated rate-of-return calculations for various assets and portfolios.

2- Quantified risk by using standard deviations and Sharpe ratios.

3- Compared the performance of portfolios across distinct risk metrics.

4- Analyzed the diversification of portfolios by using the variance, the covariance, the beta, and rolling metrics.
