# Analysis of Investment Portfolios (Challenge #4 of FinTech Bootcamp)

In this challenge, I evaluated the performance, volatility, and risk profiles of investment portfolios, and compared them against a benchmark. 

## Technologies

This project uses Python 3.7 and imports the following packages:

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - For data structuring and analysis.
[pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - For path-hadling operations.
[numpy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/) - For volatility calculations.

## Lessons Learned

1- Analyzed the returns of the portfolios over the timeframe.

2- Performed volatility calculations and determined portfolios' risk-adjusted profiles.

3- Calculated portfolios' betas and selected the fund that optimizes for diversification.
